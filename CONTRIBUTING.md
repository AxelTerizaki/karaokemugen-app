## Branches

When trying to work on a new feature or issue, remember there are two main branches to base your new branch/work off :

- `master` should be used when fixing bugs in the currently running version of Karaoke Mugen. Your fix will be included in the next "bugfix" release.
- `next` should be used when adding new features or fixing non-urgent bugs.

`master` is regularly merged within `next` when we make bugfixes on it. `next` is merged back on `master` only when doing major release versions.

So if you want to work  on a new feature for example, create a branch from `next`.
